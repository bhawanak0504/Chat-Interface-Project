# Chat Interface Project

This project is a simple web-based chat interface that allows real-time messaging between users. The interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using socket.io to handle real-time communication between 
users. The design is responsive and features a user-friendly layout for chatting.

2. Responsive design: The interface is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

3. User-friendly UI: Clean and intuitive interface for an optimal user experience.

4. Multiple user handling: Messages are displayed based on the sender, with visual cues differentiating sent and received messages.

5. Enter-to-Send: Users can send messages by pressing the Enter key.

6. Send button: Users can also send messages by clicking the send button (paper plane icon).

# Technologies Used
